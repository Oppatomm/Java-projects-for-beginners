### 1️⃣ Project 1 : Basic Calculator Program
A basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by taking numbers and commands from the user. 

**Features :**
- Enter two numbers from the user.
- Choose a type of calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Display the result.

**What I learned :**  
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Using `if-else` and `switch-case` to control the program's flow.
- Displaying results back to the user.

### 2️⃣ Project 2 : Temperature Conversion Program C to F , F to C
A temperature conversion program that can convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.

**Features :**
- Convert temperature from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) and vice versa.

**What I learned :**
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Using `switch-case`
- Using `break`
- Displaying results back to the user.
