### 1️⃣ Project 1 : Basic Calculator Program
A basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by taking numbers and commands from the user. 

**Features :**
- Enter two numbers from the user.
- Choose a type of calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Display the result.

**What I learned :**  
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Using `if-else` and `switch-case` to control the program's flow.
- Displaying results back to the user.

### 2️⃣ Project 2 : Temperature Conversion Program C to F , F to C
A temperature conversion program that can convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.

**Features :**
- Convert temperature from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) and vice versa.

**What I learned :**
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Using `switch-case`
- Using `break`
- Displaying results back to the user.

### 3️⃣ Project 3 : Grade Calculator Program 
A program to calculate grades by receiving a score and displaying the grade to the user.

**Features :**
- Receive a score from the user.
- Convert the score into a grade based on the criteria (e.g., A, B, C, D).

**What I learned :**
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Using `if-else` 
- Displaying results back to the user.


### 4️⃣ Project 4 : Program to Check Leap Year
A program to check for leap years. When the user inputs a year (AD), the program will display whether the year is a leap year or not

**Features :**
- Receive a year from the user.
- Check whether the year is a leap year or not.

**What I learned :**
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Using `if-else`
- Displaying results back to the user.

### 5️⃣ Project 5 : Program to Find Factors of Numbers
A program to find the factors of a number. The program will take a number input from the user and display all the numbers that can divide it completely.

**Features :**
- Receive a number from the user.
- Display the factors of the number.

**What I learned :**
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Use a `for-loop` and `if-else` to make the program more efficient.
- Displaying results back to the user.

### 6️⃣ Project 6 : Compound Interest Calculator Program
A program to calculate compound interest by receiving the principal amount, interest rate, and years from the user.

**Features :**
- Receive the principal amount, interest rate, and time period (in years) from the user.
- Calculate the total amount after adding compound interest.

**What I learned :**
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user.
- Learn about using the `for-loop`.
- Learn about using `BigDecimal` and `RoundingMode`.

### 7️⃣ Project 7 : Program to Count The Number of Words and Characters
A program to count the number of words and characters. The user only needs to input a text, and the program will display how many words and characters are in the text.

**Features :**
- Receive text input from the user. 
- Count the number of words and characters (excluding spaces).

**What I learned :**
- Learn about using `methods`.
