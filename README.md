### 1️⃣ Project 1 : Basic Calculator Program
A basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by taking numbers and commands from the user. 

**What I learned :**  
- Using `Scanner` to recetive input from the user
- Using `if-else` and `switch-case` to control the program's flow
- Displaying results back to the user
